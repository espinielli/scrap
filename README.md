# scrap

The scrap package is a collection of useful R functions and code
snippets. These are pieces I either wrote or (most likely) I
*discovered* on StackOverflow and that I found useful in multiple
occasions (\> 3) in my personal or professional projects.

## Installation

You can install scrap from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("espinielli/scrap")
```
